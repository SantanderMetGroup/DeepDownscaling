    "This notebook is written in the free programming language `R` (version 3.6.1) and builds on [`climate4R`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) (hereafter C4R), a suite of `R` packages developed by the [Santander Met Group](http://meteo.unican.es) for transparent climate data access, post processing (including bias correction and downscaling) and visualization. For details on climate4R (C4R hereafter), the interested reader is referred to [Iturbide et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815218303049?via%3Dihub).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the following C4R libraries are used along the notebook: [`loadeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) and [`loadeR.2nc`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR.2nc) (data loading), [`transformeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/transformeR) (data manipulation), [`downscaleR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR) and [`downscaleR.keras`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR.keras) (downscaling with neural networks) and [`visualizeR`](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/visualizeR) (visualization). To install them you may use the devtools package (e.g., ``devtools::install_github(\"SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR.keras@v1.0.0\")`` to install `downscaleR.keras`). Alternatively, you may directly install the entire C4R framework through ``conda``, C4R version 1.5.0, following the instructions provided at the end of this [page](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R). The latter option is highly recommended. Note that even with C4R v1.5.0 installed via conda, you still need to upgrade library `climate4R.UDG` with the `devtools` package by typing: ``devtools::install_github(\"SantanderMetGroup/climate4R.UDG@v0.2.2\")``."
